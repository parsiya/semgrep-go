# The Semgrep Output Structs
The version in the struct's name is the tag for the JSON schema from the
[semgrep-interfaces][si] repository. This allows us to choose the struct version
for any version of the CLI w/o having to deal with git tags.

Structs are mainly generated by [atombender/go-jsonschema][gjson] and might
contain some manual changes and bug fixes.

```
$ cd semgrep_go/output/semgrep-interfaces/
# replace with your target tag
$ git checkout v1.48.0

$ go install github.com/atombender/go-jsonschema/cmd/gojsonschema@latest

# go back to semgrep_go/output
$ cd ..
$ gojsonschema -p output -o output.go --verbose semgrep-interfaces/semgrep_output_v1.jsonschema
```

## Notes
Currently, the package is using the v1.48.0 structs. Somewhere around v1.45.0
the type of `CliError.Type` was changed from string to `ErrorType`.
