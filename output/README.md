The output structs. The version in the struct's name is the tag for the
JSON schema from the [semgrep-interfaces][si] repository. This allows us to
choose the struct version for any version of the CLI w/o having to deal with git
tags.

Structs are mainly generated by [atombender/go-jsonschema][gjson] and might
contain some manual changes and bug fixes.

```
$ go install github.com/atombender/go-jsonschema/cmd/gojsonschema@latest

$ gojsonschema -p v1_35_0 -o v1_35_0/output.go --verbose semgrep-interfaces/semgrep_output_v1.jsonschema
```
