# Test Semgrep Output
The trailing number is the Semgrep version used in the scan. The JSON output was
beautified using VS Code for easier (human) reading.

* [Juice Shop][js] was scanned with `--config=auto`.

`test-` are modified versions of the original result. They're smaller and only
include certain fields for unit tests.
